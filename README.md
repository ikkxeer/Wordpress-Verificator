# Wordpress Verificator
In short, I have developed a Python script with a built-in graphical interface that, when entering an internet link, verifies if the web page is built with Wordpress and gives a direct response.

In this case, the graphical interface is in Spanish, but I will work on adding new languages ​​to make it accessible to a wider audience.

## Examples

## Usage
```python
python main.py
```
- Once the program is executed, we only have to use the graphical interface to put it into use.
